                <p>I was born in Pasadena, CA and raised in Hermosa Beach, CA. I am currently a senior in the School of Engineering at Tufts University. With a double major in Computer Science and Human Factors Engineering, I am hoping to explore software development.  I feel confident in designing and implementing interfaces and programming in languages such as C and Qt. My interests are app development, machine learning, and green technology, but I am excited to dip my feet anywhere in the world of software development.
